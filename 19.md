=====================================================

## Merging "pay" and "withdraw" related to a same `SERVICE` in a `WALLET`

LNURL-pay may contain a `withdrawLink` in its JSON response and likewise LNURL-withdraw may contain a `payLink` in its JSON response. This is done to recognize a fact that `SERVICE` may want to allow both deposits and withdrawals to user account and make related links easily discoverable from each other.

When `WALLET` sees this it may store and show a compound item to user which would allow to both deposit and withdraw (and also to show an up-to-date `SERVICE` balance if LNURL-withdraw contains a `balanceCheck` field).

Modifications required in `SERVICE` JSON responses:

To the first callback of LNURL-pay:

```diff
 {
   callback: String,
   maxSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   minSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   metadata: String,
   tag: "payRequest",
+  withdrawLink: String,
 }
```

To the callback of LNURL-withdraw:

```diff
 {
   tag: "withdrawRequest",
   callback: String,
   k1: String,
   defaultDescription: String,
   minWithdrawable: Integer,
   maxWithdrawable: Integer,
   balanceCheck: String,
+  payLink: String,
 }
```

Both `withdrawLink` and `payLink` are raw URLs (not bech32-encoded).
