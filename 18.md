## Adding a `proofofpayer` query parameter in response call

This may come especially handy when paying to links extracted from emails since these pay links are very likely to be non-personalized (anyone can obtain lnurl-pay from email as opposed to service providing a personalized pay link to a logged in user).

The `proofofpayer` is an optional ephemeral secp256k1 public key generated by payer, a corresponding private key should be retained by payer, a payee may later ask payer to provide a public key itself or sign a random message using corresponding private key and thus provide a proof of payer.

The callback is thus modified:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&proofofpayer=<hex(ephemeral secp256k1 public key bytes)>
```
