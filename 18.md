LUD-18: Payer identity in `payRequest` protocol.
================================================

## 1. Specifying payer identity before sending a payment

Payer MAY attach a `payerid` query parameter to LNURL-PAY callback with value set to JSON array:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>&payerid=[<identity record>, ...]
```

JSON array may contain one or more records of the following forms:

1. `{ "tag": "name", "value": <free-form string> }`
2. `{ "tag": "pubkey", "value": hex(<randomly generated secp256k1 pubkey>) }`
3. `{ "tag": "auth", "value": hex(<linkingKey>), "sig": hex(sign(utf8ToBytes(<k1>), <linkingPrivKey>)) }`
4. `{ "tag": "identifier", "value": <internet identifier> }`
5. `{ "tag": "email", "value": <email address> }`

## 2. `PayerIDs` record

If `SERVICE` wants to get one or more types of payer identities from `WALLET` then it must alter its JSON response to the first callback to include a `payerIDs` field, as follows:

```diff
 {
   callback: String,
   maxSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   minSendable: MilliSatoshi,
   metadata: String,
+  payerIDs: {
+    "name": Any,
+    "pubkey": Any,
+    "identifier": Any,
+    "email": Any,
+    "auth": {
+       "mandatory": Boolean,
+       "k1": String // hex encoded 32 bytes of challenge
+    ]
+  },
   tag: "payRequest",
 }
```

The mere presence of each key in the `payerIDs` record signals that it CAN be included by `WALLET`. The values don't mean anything and are to be discarded -- with the exception of `auth`, which MUST be an object containing `k1` and `mandatory`. In case `mandatory` is true `WALLET` MUST send the payment with a [lnurl-auth](04.md) key and signature and the tag `auth` (as specified in section 1 above).

`WALLET` SHOULD NOT send payer identity types omitted in `payerIDs` record, none at all if record is not present.

## 3. Committing payer to the invoice

If `SERVICE` requests (section 2) and `WALLET` sends a `payerid` record in the callback (section 1), the payer IDs must be committed to the metadata before the invoice is created.

`SERVICE` MUST append it to the metadata as it was received, inside a new record called `application/payerids`, as follows:

```diff
 [
   ["text/plain", "description"], // example
   ["image/png;base64", "AAA=="], // example
+  ["application/payerids", <array of identity records as received from WALLET>]
 ]
```

After doing that, `SERVICE` can proceed to hash the metadata and include that hash in the generated BOLT11 invoice as the `descriptionHash` field.

On its own side, `WALLET` must do the same thing before hashing the metadata and checking its hashed value against the `descriptionHash` field of the invoice received from `SERVICE`.
